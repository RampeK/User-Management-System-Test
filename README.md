# User Management System

## About
This User Management System is a web-based application that provides dynamic user interaction features. It's designed using HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to create a user-friendly and responsive interface.

## Features
- **Dynamic User Loading**: Users can be dynamically loaded and displayed in the application using AJAX calls.
- **User Operations**: Users have the ability to create, edit, and delete user information.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and can adapt to various screen sizes, thanks to Bootstrap.
- **Interactive Modals**: For editing and creating user details, modals are used to provide a seamless interactive experience.
- **Simulates Changes**: The edits made to the profiles and deleting profiles are only simulated and are not updated to the servers database or other data location. The servers messages shown are there to confirm the site registers the changes.

## Installation
To get started with this application, clone the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/RampeK/User-Management-System-Test.git

Since this project uses Bootstrap and jQuery from CDN, there's no need for additional package installations. Simply open the index.html file in your browser to start using the application.

## Usage
- Load Users: Click on the 'Load Users' button to fetch and display user data.
- Create User: Use the 'Create User' button to add a new user via the displayed modal form.
- Edit User: Each user has an 'Edit' button which, when clicked, allows for the modification of user details in a modal form.
- Delete User: Next to each user's details is a 'Delete' button that removes the user from the list.
